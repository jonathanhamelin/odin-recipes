    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This EASY Lasagna Soup tastes just like lasagna with layers of cheesy noodles 
        smothered in rich marinara infused with garlic, onion and Italian spices all 
        smothered Parmesan, mozzarella and ricotta  – drool – and all you have to do 
        is brown your beef, dump in the ingredients and simmer away! You might never 
        go back to traditional lasagna again!

    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <p>
        *I love lasagna noodles in this recipe – they are slurpilicious! 
        You can also replace the noodles with 2 1/2 cups uncooked small shells 
        if desired and simmer for less time.
    </p>
    <p>
        **If you want to omit the heavy cream but still would like a thicker soup 
        then I suggest whisking 2 teaspoons cornstarch with some of the chicken broth 
        and adding to the soup to simmer and thicken.
