    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This pizza dough recipe is very simple and only takes about 10 minutes 
        to prepare. I make mine in the food processor, but it is not essential. 
        If you donâ€™t have a food processor, make a well in the flour and salt 
        and pour the liquids to the center. Work with your fingers gradually 
        adding dry ingredients to the liquids. What is important is to get a soft 
        dough and to let it rise in a warm place. Freezes well.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup (250 ml) warm water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon (5 ml) instant yeast</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon (5 ml) sugar</li>
        <li>2 cups (300 g) all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon (5 ml) salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>

        <li>
            In a bowl, combine the water, yeast and sugar. Let stand until 
            the mixture foams on top, about 5 minutes.

            In a food processor, it is important to work with the plastic blade 
            or the dough hook. Combine the flour and salt. Increase the speed to 
            medium and add the yeast mixture until a soft ball forms.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove the dough from the bowl and knead for a few minutes on a floured 
            surface to prevent sticking.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place in a lightly oiled bowl and cover with a clean cloth. 
            Let the dough rise for about 30 minutes in warm and draft-free area. 
            Cut the dough in half.
        </li>
        <li>
            Use the pizza dough immediately or refrigerate it (less than 48 hours), 
            otherwise place it in an airtight bag and freeze.
        </li>

            This recipe will make two 23-cm (9-inch) thin-crust pizzas 
            or two 20-cm (8-inch) thicker crust pizzas.
